My previous blog was on m1kola.com which now just redirects to this domain. It was a personal blog, but it has become useless because of Facebook and other social media. There are some reasons why I have decided to create a new one.</p>\n<!-- more -->\n<p>The first and the most important reason - I need more practice in English. I use English every day in chats with colleagues or on Github, but when I write fast I can’t concentrate on grammar or on vocabulary. It’s harder to remember new words when I work. So I will try to use the wider spectrum of words then at work.</p>\n<p>The second reason - I need a place where I can put my technical notes. I have some bits of knowledge in <a href="https://github.com/django/django">Django</a> and <a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail">Wagtail CMS</a> and want to share them with other developers. For example, in the nearest feature, I’m going to write a blog post about migrating a Django model from one app to another. It’s covered somewhere on StackOverflow, but it was hard to find.</p>\n<p>And last, but not least - I need a project to test Wagtail CMS. Of course, we have ”<a href="https://github.com/wagtail/wagtaildemo">wagtaildemo</a>”, but it’s synthetic project and I want to have a real word project. Yes, I can upgrade client’s projects first, but it’s a bit risky, I think.</p>\n<p>That’s all for today. See you soon!</p>',frontmatter:{title:"Hello, World!",subtitle:null,date:"Sep 5, 2016",shareImage:null}}},pathContext:{slug:"/blog/hello-world/",previous:null,next:{fields:{slug:"/blog/how-move-model-between-two-django-apps/"},frontmatter:{title:"How to move a model between two Django apps"}}}}}});
