It's my second attempt to write a blog. My previous blog was on m1kola.com which now just redirects to this domain. It was a personal blog, but it has become useless because of Facebook and other social media. There are some reasons why I have decided to create a new one.
<!-- more -->

The first and the most important reason - I need more practice in English. I use English every day in chats with colleagues or on Github, but when I write fast I can't concentrate on grammar or on vocabulary. It's harder to remember new words when I work. So I will try to use the wider spectrum of words then at work.

The second reason - I need a place where I can put my technical notes. I have some bits of knowledge in [Django](https://github.com/django/django) and [Wagtail CMS](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtail) and want to share them with other developers. For example, in the nearest feature, I'm going to write a blog post about migrating a Django model from one app to another. It's covered somewhere on StackOverflow, but it was hard to find.

And last, but not least - I need a project to test Wagtail CMS. Of course, we have "[wagtaildemo](https://github.com/wagtail/wagtaildemo)", but it's synthetic project and I want to have a real word project. Yes, I can upgrade client's projects first, but it's a bit risky, I think.

That's all for today. See you soon!
